# World-Bank-Debt-Data
The dataset uses World Bank Debt data from the year 1970 to 2021. In this project, I analyze international debt data from The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. The calculation is done in Billion USD.
