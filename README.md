# World-Bank-Debt-Data
### The dataset uses [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/debt-statistics) debt data from 1970 to 2021, and I have collectively summed all the years into a single column named "debt". It contains all debt indicators like Central Bank bilateral debt, External debt stocks. In this project, I analyze international debt data containing information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. The results are in USD Billion.
